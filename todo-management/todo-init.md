Initialize a comprehensive todo list for the current task using the TodoWrite tool.

Analyze the user's request and:
1. Break it down into logical subtasks
2. Identify dependencies between tasks
3. Order tasks by priority and dependencies
4. Create clear, actionable todo items with:
   - `content`: Imperative form (e.g., "Run tests")
   - `activeForm`: Present continuous form (e.g., "Running tests")
   - `status`: Set all to "pending" initially

Use the TodoWrite tool to create the todo list immediately.
