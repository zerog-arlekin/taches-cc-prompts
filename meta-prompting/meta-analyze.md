Analyze the current task and provide:

1. **Task Decomposition**: Break down the request into atomic subtasks
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify which common patterns apply (CRUD, API integration, data transformation, etc.)
3. **Risk Assessment**: Highlight potential issues or edge cases
4. **Optimization Opportunities**: Suggest improvements to approach or implementation

Format the analysis as a structured plan with clear steps and decision points.
