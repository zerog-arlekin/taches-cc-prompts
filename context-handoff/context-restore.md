Restore context from a previous session.

Look for `CONTEXT_HANDOFF.md` in the project root and:

1. Read and summarize the saved context
2. Identify where work was left off
3. Verify current state matches expected state
4. Highlight any discrepancies or changes since handoff
5. Present a clear "resumption plan" with next steps

Ask clarifying questions if the handoff document is unclear or missing critical information.
