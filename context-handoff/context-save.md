Save the current working context to prepare for session handoff.

Create a comprehensive context document that includes:

1. **Current State**:
   - What tasks are in progress
   - What has been completed
   - What remains to be done

2. **Technical Context**:
   - Files modified
   - Key decisions made
   - Architecture patterns used

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Immediate next actions
   - Known blockers or issues
   - Testing requirements

4. **Handoff Notes**:
   - Important context for next session
   - Assumptions made
   - Edge cases to consider

Save this to a file named `CONTEXT_HANDOFF.md` in the project root.
